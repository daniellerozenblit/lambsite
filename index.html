    <h1> I Love Lamb </h1>

    <h2>Why this page?</h2>
    <p> Hello homie slices. I made this page for my computer science class in order to show off my sick nasty html skills that I just learned. Woo woo making web pages is fun! </p>

    <h2>Why lambs?</h2>
        <p> Lambs are pretty cute and fluffy and fun. I've been thinking about them a lot lately. Are they my favorite animal? Maybe. For a while I thought my favorite animal was a dolphin but lambs are fluffy which is kinda cute XD idk.</p>

    <h2>What's on this page?</h2>
        <p> Honestly we got some good stuff happening on this page. There's some random sheep facts, some recipes involving lamb (is that dark? whoops) and a study I did involving colorful lambs and Brown students. Please enjoy!</p>
